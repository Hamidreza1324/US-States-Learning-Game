## Overview
A map-based educational game where users identify U.S. states. Correct answers are written on the map, hints can be requested, and missed states are automatically saved for review. This project demonstrates **data handling**, **event-driven interaction**, and **graphics rendering** using the Turtle module.

## Features
- Interactive map of the **United States**
- Accepts case-insensitive state name guesses
- Displays each correct state on its accurate coordinates
- **Hint system** to reveal an unguessed state
- Real-time **score tracking**
- Saves unguessed states to `states_to_learn.csv`
- Clean, modular, beginner-friendly code structure

## Installation
Open terminal (Linux/Mac) or PowerShell/Command Prompt (Windows):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamidreza1324/US-States-Learning-Game.git
cd US-States-Learning-Game

# Linux/Mac:
python3 main.py

# Windows:
python main.py
```
## Skills & Concepts
-Python programming fundamentals
